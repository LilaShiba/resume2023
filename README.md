## 💁‍♀️ About Me
Hi there! 👋 My name is Kyle and I'm a computer scientist with a passion for education and technology. 🖥️ When I'm not coding, you can usually find me spending time with my Shiba Inu 🐕, exploring the city, or reading a good book.

As a cancer survivor 🎗️ and a member of the trans community 🌈, I am deeply committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in all areas of my life. Whether I'm working on a coding project, teaching a class, or just enjoying time with friends, I strive to create a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone around me.

# Why Dark Mode 🌃🌿

Dark mode saves power, especially on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays. These displays work by lighting up individual pixels rather than using a backlight. When the background is dark or black, fewer pixels need to be lit up, which means less power is consumed. 📱💡

## Benefits for the Environment 🌍

By saving power, dark mode can help reduce the overall energy consumption of your devices. This can lead to:

- Reduced electricity usage 🏡⚡
- Lower carbon footprint 🦶🌳
- Longer battery life, which means fewer battery replacements and less electronic waste 🌐🔋

So, go ahead and switch to dark mode to save power and contribute to a greener planet! 🌃🌿🌎

Remember, every little bit helps when it comes to protecting our environment! 🤗💚
