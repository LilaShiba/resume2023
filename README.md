#### About Me

Greetings! 👋 I'm Lila Josey James, a dedicated computer scientist driven by a passion for education and technology. Beyond coding, you'll often find me cherishing moments with my [Shiba Inu companion](https://www.mondou.com/en-CA/blogs/advice/dog/the-shiba-inu-japans-national-treasure-ad11.html) 🐕, exploring [urban landscapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Horse_Bay), or immersing myself in enriching [literature](https://www.amazon.com/Too-Like-Lightning-Terra-Ignota/dp/0765378019). As a [resilient](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/intensive-chemotherapy) cancer survivor 🎗️ and advocate within the [trans community](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/transgender) 🌈, I bring a profound commitment to fostering diversity and inclusivity in all facets of my endeavors.

My professional ethos revolves around cultivating welcoming and supportive environments. Whether leading coding projects, imparting knowledge in educational settings, or simply enjoying moments with peers, I consistently strive to nurture an atmosphere where everyone feels valued and empowered to thrive.
