## About Me
Hi there! 👋 My name is Lila, and I'm a computer scientist with a passion for education and technology. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me spending time with my Shiba Inu 🐕, exploring the city, or reading a good book. As a cancer survivor 🎗 and a member of the trans community 🌈, I am deeply committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in all areas of my life. Whether I'm working on a coding project, teaching a class, or just enjoying time with friends, I strive to create a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone around me.
