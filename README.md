## 💁‍♀️ About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Lila, a computer scientist with a fervent passion for education and technology. 🖥️ Outside of coding, I'm often found enjoying time with my Shiba Inu 🐕, exploring urban landscapes, or delving into a captivating book.

As a proud cancer survivor 🎗️ and a vibrant member of the trans community 🌈, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusivity in every sphere of my life. Whether it's through coding projects, educational endeavors, or simply in my daily interactions, my goal is to cultivate a welcoming and supportive atmosphere for all.
